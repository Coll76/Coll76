<h2 align="left">ðŸš€ Welcome to my corner of the digital world</h2>

<p align="left">
Once upon a time, every great product was just an idea.  
Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by the space between a problem and its solution â€” that magical gap where creativity, logic, and storytelling meet.  

My name is <b>Collins Kubu</b>, and Iâ€™m a django/django-rest backend developer who thrives on turning raw ideas into prototypes that grow into meaningful products.  

For me, coding isnâ€™t just about making things work.  
Itâ€™s about designing backends that tell a story: a story of peopleâ€™s challenges, their journeys, and the solutions that help them move forward.  
Thatâ€™s why I focus on niche problems, because inside those hidden corners lie the opportunities to create something truly impactful.

### ðŸ“– My Approach
- I listen for the struggles people often overlook.  
- I sketch solutions like a storyteller drafts chapters, building prototypes that evolve into real products.  
- I believe people donâ€™t connect with features alone. They connect with journeys, with stories, and with solutions that fit seamlessly into their lives.
